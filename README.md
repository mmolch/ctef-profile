# ctef-profile
A simple one-file (well, with header two-files) library written in C99 that lets you profile your C / C++ application visually by writing the trace into a json file in the trace event format used by Chrome / Chromium. This file can then be opened with Chrome's built-in tracing application (url: chrome://tracing)
